# Cache

The Cache class consists of a linked list of (key, value) pairs which can be accessed via the [] operator. 

When initialising a Cache you have the freedom to set the types of the keys and values, as well as set the cache's capacity.

There are locks on reordering the cache, and logging to the console when the capacity is exceeded.
